# 20020 Bowl Game map project

This is a project to recreate the map for the Bowl Game, as envisioned in Secret Base's [_20020_](https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/21410129/20020), as a KML file.

The best way to help right now is with field surveying. [Here's the process.](survey/README.md)

Progress:
- [x] List of all teams and colors
- [ ] [Survey](survey/) all 111 fields
- [x] Draw field guide lines in KML
- [ ] Draw fields in KML
- [ ] Draw field markers (e.g. "LOU" where the 0 yard line is) in KML

Stretch goals:
- Web version: Zoom to any yard line on any field
