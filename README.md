[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5edae002-f081-4f63-8087-d07939a4aebb/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/20020/deploys)

This is a project to recreate the map for the Bowl Game, as envisioned in Secret Base's [_20020_](https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/21410129/20020), as a KML file.

The best way to help right now is with field surveying. [Here's the process.](survey/README.md)
