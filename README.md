## map surveying

Use Google Earth Pro and fly to a college football stadium. [20020 team list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19Amwc2L64pX_mQWXDVMir0a7JLqknaKNRjQdpLypOwU/edit#gid=0)

Put 10 markers at the intersections of the hash marks and the 10, 30, and 50 yard lines. I've been surveying them at an eye altitude of 25 meters.

Export the KML for those markers. File names use the team names in `data/teams.csv`.
