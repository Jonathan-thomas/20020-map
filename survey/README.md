## map surveying

**[Team list](../data/teams.csv)**

Use Google Earth Pro and fly to a college football stadium.

Put 10 markers at the intersections of the hash marks and the 10, 30, and 50 yard lines. I've been surveying them at an eye altitude of 25 meters.

Export the KML for those markers. File names use the team names in the [team list](../data/teams.csv).

You can create a pull request, create an issue and upload the file, or email the file (and how you want to be attributed in the commit log) to iliana@buttslol.net.
